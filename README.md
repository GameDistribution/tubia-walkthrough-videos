# Tubia walkthrough video's
This is the documentation of the Tubia video player project. An HTML5 player used for displaying gaming walkthrough video's matching its context.

Tubia.com offers walkthrough videoâ€™s to gaming publishers, for free. Many gamers seek out helpful tutorials and videos to help them when they get stuck in a game. We facilitate this and create helpful content that helps gamers beat their favorite web games! By embedding our video walkthroughs on your website, you can not only help your users beat a difficult part of a game, but also increase your revenue and user engagement.

Running into any issues? Check out the Wiki of the github repository before mailing to <a href="support@tubia.com" target="_blank">support@tubia.com</a>

## Implementation within a page
The player should be implemented within a page by loading it through our CDN. Specific information of the player features and usages can be found at the <a href="https://github.com/GameDistribution/tubia-walkthrough-videos/wiki" target="_blank">wiki</a>.

### Example
Add the following script to your document.
```
window["TUBIA_OPTIONS"] = {
    "container": '[YOUR CONTAINER ELEMENT ID HERE]',
    "publisherId": '[YOUR PUBLISHER ID HERE]',
    "gameId": '[YOUR GAME ITS IDENTIFIER]',
    "title": '[YOUR GAME ITS TITLE]',
    "category": '[A SINGLE CATEGORY NAME ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR GAME WITHIN YOUR WEBSITE]',
};
(function (d, s, id) {
    var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];
    if (d.getElementById(id)) return;
    js = d.createElement(s);
    js.id = id;
    js.src = 'https://tubia.gamedistribution.com/libs/gd/gd.min.js';
    fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);
}(document, 'script', 'tubia-playerjs'));
```

## Deployment
Deployment of this repository to production environments is done through TeamCity.

## Installation for development
Install the following programs:
* [NodeJS LTS](https://nodejs.org/).
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).

Pull in the rest of the requirements using npm:
```
npm install
```

Setup a local node server, watch changes and update your browser view automatically:
```
grunt
```

Make a production build for the CDN solution. The npmjs version uses a "prepublish"-task defined within package.json, which does a simple babel task, similar to this task:
```
grunt build
```
