# Tubia walkthrough video's
This is the documentation of the Tubia video player project. An HTML5 player used for displaying gaming walkthrough video's matching its context.

Tubia.com offers walkthrough videoâ€™s to gaming publishers, for free. Many gamers seek out helpful tutorials and videos to help them when they get stuck in a game. We facilitate this and create helpful content that helps gamers beat their favorite web games! By embedding our video walkthroughs on your website, you can not only help your users beat a difficult part of a game, but also increase your revenue and user engagement.

Running into any issues? Check out the Wiki of the github repository before mailing to <a href="support@tubia.com" target="_blank">support@tubia.com</a>

## Implementation within a page
The player should be implemented within a page by embedding it within a simple iframe or as web component. Specific information of the player features and usages can be found at the <a href="https://github.com/GameDistribution/tubia-walkthrough-videos/wiki" target="_blank">wiki</a>.

### Embed as <iframe>
It is also possible to embed the Tubia video player within a simple <iframe> element. However, you won't be able to hook into the callbacks.
```
<iframe 
    scrolling="no" 
    frameborder="0" 
    allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" 
    style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;" width="640" height="480" 
    src="https://player.tubia.com/?publisherid=[YOUR PUBLISHER ID HERE]&gameid=[YOUR GAME ITS IDENTIFIER]&pageurl=[CURRENT PAGE URL ENCODED]&title=[YOUR GAME ITS URL ENCODED TITLE]&colormain=[PLAYER THEME HEX COLOR CODE]&coloraccent=[PLAYER THEME HEX COLOR CODE]&gdprtracking=[SET BY YOUR GDPR SOLUTION]&gdprtargeting=[SET BY YOUR GDPR SOLUTION]&langcode=[LANGUAGE CODE - REGION CODE]">
</iframe>
```
Use the following query variables.

| Property | Mandatory | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| publisherid | Yes | '' | Your Tubia publisher identifier. |
| gameid | Yes | '' | A unique identifier of your page content. We use this data to match a video with your identifier. |
| title | Yes | '' | The name of your game. This values is used within the video player, but we also use this data to match a video with your title. Make sure its value is URL encoded. |
| pageurl | Yes | '' | The full URL of the current page, make sure its value is encoded. |
| colormain | No | '' | The main theme color of the HTML5 video player, use a CSS hex code (ff0080), without the #. |
| coloraccent | No | '' | The accent theme color of the HTML5 video player, use a CSS hex code (ff0080), without the #. |
| gdprtracking | Mandatory for European end-users | '' | Enable client tracking solutions. |
| gdprtargeting | Mandatory for European end-users | '' | Enable client advertisement targeting solutions. |
| langcode | No | 'en-us' | Currently only used for localising phrases within advertisements. |
| debug | No | '' | Enable debugging. Please keep it to false when publishing. |

### Embed as web component
Add the following script to your document.
```
window["TUBIA_OPTIONS"] = {
    "container": '[YOUR CONTAINER ELEMENT ID HERE]',
    "publisherId": '[YOUR PUBLISHER ID HERE]',
    "gameId": '[YOUR GAME ITS IDENTIFIER]',
    "title": '[YOUR GAME ITS TITLE]',
    "gdprTracking": true,
    "gdprTargeting": true,
};
(function (d, s, id) {
    var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];
    if (d.getElementById(id)) return;
    js = d.createElement(s);
    js.id = id;
    js.src = 'https://player.tubia.com/libs/gd/gd.js';
    fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);
}(document, 'script', 'tubia-playerjs'));
```

You can also initialise the Tubia instance by simply (re)creating it. This is useful for when you want to load Tubia within a web application. Just make sure you pass the options as arguments in the constructor, instead of binding them to the window element. Otherwise the instance would auto initialise.
```
new Tubia.Player.default({
    "container": '[YOUR CONTAINER ELEMENT ID HERE]',
    "publisherId": '[YOUR PUBLISHER ID HERE]',
    "gameId": '[YOUR GAME ITS IDENTIFIER]',
    "title": '[YOUR GAME ITS TITLE]',
    "gdprTracking": [SET BY YOUR GDPR SOLUTION],
    "gdprTargeting": [SET BY YOUR GDPR SOLUTION],
});
```

##### Callbacks
You can hook into the following callbacks:

| onStart | nothing | The very first moment everything is initializing. |
| onFound | {Object} - Video data | When a video - matching with your game - has been found. |
| onReady | {Object} - Player instance | When the HTML5 player is ready to play the video. This callback will only be returned when onStart and onFound have returned before. |
| onError | {Object} - Error data | When any error happens inside of Tubia. |

#### Styling/ CSS
The video player will be embedded straight into your web page as a component, so not within an iframe. This means you're free to completely style it to your wishes or even write plugins.

## Repository
The player is maintained on a public github repository.
<a href="https://github.com/gamedistribution/tubia-walkthrough-videos" target="_blank">https://github.com/gamedistribution/tubia-walkthrough-videos</a>

## Deployment
Deployment of this repository to production environments is done through TeamCity. The `./src/index.html` file should be deployed manually within the root of the bucket. This file allows the embedding of the player within an iframe.

## Installation for development
Install the following programs:
* [NodeJS LTS](https://nodejs.org/).
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).

Pull in the rest of the requirements using npm:
```
npm install
```

Setup a local node server, watch changes and update your browser view automatically:
```
grunt
```

Make a production build for the CDN solution. The npmjs version uses a "prepublish"-task defined within package.json, which does a simple babel task, similar to this task:
```
grunt build
```
