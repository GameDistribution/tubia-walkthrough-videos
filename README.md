# Tubia walkthrough video's
This is the documentation of the Tubia video player project. An HTML5 player used for displaying gaming walkthrough video's matching its context.

Tubia.com offers walkthrough videoâ€™s to gaming publishers, for free. Many gamers seek out helpful tutorials and videos to help them when they get stuck in a game. We facilitate this and create helpful content that helps gamers beat their favorite web games! By embedding our video walkthroughs on your website, you can not only help your users beat a difficult part of a game, but also increase your revenue and user engagement.

Running into any issues? Check out the Wiki of the github repository before mailing to <a href="support@tubia.com" target="_blank">support@tubia.com</a>

## Implementation within a page
The player should be implemented within a page by embedding it within a simple iframe or as component. Specific information of the player features and usages can be found at the <a href="https://github.com/GameDistribution/tubia-walkthrough-videos/wiki" target="_blank">wiki</a>.

### Embed as <iframe>
Embed the Tubia video player within a simple <iframe> element. However, you won't be able to hook into the callbacks.
```
<iframe 
    scrolling="no" 
    frameborder="0" 
    allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" 
    style="margin: 0; padding: 0;" width="640" height="480" 
    src="https://player.tubia.com/?publisherid=[YOUR PUBLISHER ID HERE]&pageurl=[CURRENT PAGE URL ENCODED]&title=[YOUR GAME ITS URL ENCODED TITLE]&colormain=[PLAYER THEME HEX COLOR CODE]&coloraccent=[PLAYER THEME HEX COLOR CODE]&gdprtracking=[SET BY YOUR GDPR SOLUTION]&gdprtargeting=[SET BY YOUR GDPR SOLUTION]&langcode=[LANGUAGE CODE - REGION CODE]">
</iframe>
```
Use the following query variables.

| Property | Mandatory | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| publisherid | Yes | '' | Your Tubia publisher identifier. |
| title | Yes | '' | The name of your game. This values is used within the video player, but we also use this data to match a video with your title. Make sure its value is URL encoded. |
| pageurl | Yes | '' | The full URL of the current page, make sure its value is encoded. |
| colormain | No | '' | The main theme color of the HTML5 video player, use a CSS hex code (ff0080), without the #. |
| coloraccent | No | '' | The accent theme color of the HTML5 video player, use a CSS hex code (ff0080), without the #. |
| gdprtracking | Mandatory for European end-users | '' | Enable client tracking solutions. |
| gdprtargeting | Mandatory for European end-users | '' | Enable client advertisement targeting solutions. |
| langcode | No | 'en-us' | Currently only used for localising phrases within advertisements. |
| debug | No | '' | Enable debugging. Please keep it to false when publishing. |

### Embed as component
Add the following script to your document. This solution simply loads the Tubia player within a generated <iframe> element. Using this implementation allows you to hook into the callback methods, which are invoked through the iframe using the PostMessage Web API.
```
<script type="application/javascript">
    window["TUBIA_OPTIONS"] = {
        "container": '[YOUR CONTAINER ELEMENT ID HERE]',
        "publisherId": '[YOUR PUBLISHER ID HERE]',
        "title": '[YOUR GAME ITS TITLE]',
        "colorMain": 'ff0080',
        "colorAccent": '00ff80',
        "gdprTracking": true,
        "gdprTargeting": true,
        "onNotFound": function (data) {
            console.info('Could not find the video: ', data);
        },
    };
    !function(e,t,n){var a,r=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0];e.getElementById(n)||((a=e.createElement(t)).async=!0,a.id=n,a.src="https://player.tubia.com/libs/gd/gd.min.js",r.parentNode.insertBefore(a,r))}(document,"script","tubia-playerjs");
</script>
```

#### Matching video's
Once successfully embedded it can take up to a day for a video to be matched with your game page. Video matching is done automatically by matching your game title and your URL with known entries within our Tubia matchmaking system.

#### Callbacks & Properties

| onNotFound | {Object} - Error message | When a video - matching with your game - could not be found. |
| onReady | {Object} - Player instance | When the HTML5 player is ready to play the video. This callback will only be returned when onStart and onFound have returned before. |
| onError | {Object} - Error data | When any error happens inside of Tubia. |

#### Styling/ CSS
The video player will be embedded straight into your web page as a component, so not within an iframe. This means you're free to completely style it to your wishes or even write plugins.

## Repository
The player is maintained on a public github repository.
<a href="https://github.com/gamedistribution/tubia-walkthrough-videos" target="_blank">https://github.com/gamedistribution/tubia-walkthrough-videos</a>

## Deployment
Deployment of this repository to production environments is done through TeamCity. The `./src/index.html` file should be deployed manually within the root of the bucket. This file allows the embedding of the player within an iframe.

## Installation for development
Install the following programs:
* [NodeJS LTS](https://nodejs.org/).
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).
* [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/install).

Pull in the rest of the requirements using npm:
```
npm install
```

Setup a local node server, watch changes and update your browser view automatically:
```
grunt
```

Make a production build for the CDN solution. The npmjs version uses a "prepublish"-task defined within package.json, which does a simple babel task, similar to this task:
```
grunt build
```
